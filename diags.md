- Devices need to have the same [public IP](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+ip) to see each other.
- Hotspot provider must be a router inorder to handle a maximum of 254 connections in a same network.<br>
- The internet connection is needed till Web page is loaded & the chat space is accessed.<br>
- The data transferred is distributed by the Host to the co-clients by using WebRTC server, Only the devices in the network can access the chat & This is absolutely localized, Not a single data is given to cloud. <br>
- This also means that's the data shared won't go through any end-to-end encryption technologies, & There will be no supervision/moderation controls available in the network. Built in a hope that Everyone will act responsibly in the space.
- Old mobile phones may not function properly due to the Technology's limited capabilities.
